* Questions
- Can node-watch watch a directory? (yes)
* Priority list
- [X] Change watch object creation to new ni.watcher({});
- Support current test cases
  - [X] Count number of files in dir (and sub dir) are correct (proves recursion is working and .files and dirs are ignored).
  - [X] Edit template and see it correctly updates index.
- [ ] Support future cases:
  - [ ] Adding new template
  - [ ] Deleting existing template
  - [ ] Renaming file
* Future
- Sort options on templates (A-z, Z-a, or Array)
- Add and remove events. Currently NodeInterval only supports listening for
 changes. In the future it will also listen for adding and removing of templates.
- A polling interval option.
- JS compression. Include [[https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS][UglifyJS]] to optionally auto-compress and concat JS
 files in addition to templates. Note that we don't plan on compressing
 templates as they can contain a combination of HTML/CSS/JS and
 template-library-specific shorthand that a normal compressor wouldn't
 understand.
